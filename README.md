# About

“From the Void” is an ambient, electroacoustic composition that creates a spatialized, 
sonic atmosphere. It was composed using Supercollider 3.13.0 and is designed to be 
played using an 8-speaker ring around the listener with an additional LFE channel: a 
diagram of this setup is given in Figure 2. Alternatively, a setting in the Supercollider 
code makes it possible to play this work through a two-channel system, and a stereo 
mixdown is provided.

This work takes heavy inspiration from the compositions of Arvo Pärt, such as 
“Spiegel im Spiegel” (1978) and “De Profundis” (1980). Pärt’s repertory is highly 
spiritual, encompassing a wide range of styles and techniques including serialism and 
minimalist procedures, but since 1976 is especially defined by his signature 
Tintinnabuli technique (Shenton 2012, 1–2). In addition to this, Shenton notes that 
silence surrounding a work is of great spiritual importance to Pärt, with the idea of 
musical material emerging from silence at the beginning of a piece, and receding into 
nothingness at the end of a work being a salient one (2020, 118).

“From the Void” takes Pärt’s Tintinnabuli technique, along with the idea of 
emergence described above to create a piece that is fundamentally about achieving 
clarity from obscurity, and above all transformation. The sound material is generated 
exclusively through white noise passed through resonant band-pass filters: the 
bandwidth of each filter is slowly adjusted throughout the piece to produce pitch 
content, which eventually converges into a Tintinnabuli structure.

There is a great importance of scales and triads in the Tintinnabuli style, which 
is evident in many of Pärt’s works including those discussed above (Brauneiss 2012, 
55–56). Building on Hillier’s work, Brauneiss identifies four modes defining a scalic 
direction relative to a central pitch. The first and third modes are of particular 
importance to this piece, which respectively ascend from, and descend to a central 
pitch (ibid., 62).

As summarised in Figure 3, “From the Void” uses two melody voices which 
move in parallel motion; a technique described by Brauneiss as “pari intervallo” after 
Pärt’s work of the same name (ibid., 65). The voices both alternate between the first 
and third modes relative to a central pitch of E♮. From this, two Tintinnabuli voices 
are created from a C♯ minor triad: these eventually emerge in the piece’s texture, 
alternating between the first superior and inferior positions as described by 
Brauneiss (ibid., 56). These voices are also at times doubled by percussive sounds, 
which are designed to be reminiscent of water droplets. In line with Pärt’s treatment 
of silence, the piece is concluded by dissipating the texture: the melody voices, 
followed by the Tintinnabuli voices lose coherence and eventually dissolve into 
oblivion.
